# Blinkit-Analysis
Overview
The Blinkit Grocery Analysis Excel Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing key aspects of grocery store data to identify trends and insights related to outlets and products. Using Microsoft Excel, the project includes well-structured datasets and charts that illustrate:

Outlet Size: Analysis of how store sizes vary across outlets and their impact on performance.
Outlet Type: Categorization of outlet types (e.g., supermarkets, grocery stores) to explore operational trends.
Outlet Location: Insights into how geographical distribution influences sales and customer preferences.
Item Fat Content: Evaluation of product fat content categories (low, medium, high) and their distribution.
Item Type: Breakdown of items into categories (e.g., beverages, snacks, household items) to identify top-performing segments.
Outlet Establishment Year: Examination of how the age of outlets impacts their success.
The project employs pivot tables, charts, and filters to ensure data analysis is clear and interactive. This Excel-based solution provides valuable insights for understanding grocery store performance and trends.
